Build out a new route and page called "About the Author". 

Complete the following steps:

1) Create a new HTML file called ``about.html``. Extend this
   from ``base.html``.

2) Create a new flask route that renders ``about.html``.

3) Create a new JS file (use the filetype ``.jsx``) and create
   a component similar to the `Homepage` component called `About`.

3) Add two things to the ``about.html``

- A ``<script>`` tag that pulls in your new ``.jsx`` file. 

- A ``<div>`` component with an ``id`` attribute of your choosing.

4) Mount the new `About` component onto the ``<div>`` you created
   in the previous section. You can do this by adding the following
   line to your new JSX file.

.. code-block:: javascript

  ReactDOM.render(<About />, document.getElementById('ID_YOU_CHOSE'));
